Abstract:

This paper establishes industry labor market monopsony as an important determi-
nant of labor share dynamics. I expand work from the resurgent monopsony literature
to construct a theoretical linkage between employment concentration and rm and in-
dustry labor shares. Utilizing regional industry data from the U.S. Economic Census
and Bureau of Economic Analysis from 2002-2019, I test the impact of rising labor mar-
ket concentration on regional labor shares. I nd an increase in labor market monop-
sony is associated with labor share decline in most private industries, most markedly in
manufacturing. I then extend the analysis by considering the roles of deindustrializing
structural change and globalization on regional labor market concentration, thereby
linking these macroeconomic forces to labor share decline.
